                  <p>
                    The structure of a defect card in targetprocess should be in accordance with the following guidelines:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The body of the defect starts with a detailed description. Please be sure to include all the relevant information, while avoiding extra unneeded information that may confuse the reader.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The description is separated from the steps to reproduce by a horizontal line. This can either be inserted via the user interface of the editor, or by adding a &lt;hr&gt; tag while inspecting the source of the defect body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second section contains details on where the issue reproduces and what the steps to reproduce are. Credentials and environment variables are typed in on a single line in the format “system > user > password (optional) > browser (optional)”. The browser is only required if the issue is browser specific. Examples include “system.meddbase.com > MMS.User@HCA > Mozilla Firefox” or “qa.meddbase.com > BRL.Vlad > myPassword”. Following this line are the steps to reproduce, which
                    must be typed on sequentially numbered rows. Please don’t skip any logical step, while also making sure that the STR are short and concise, as not to confuse the reader. Ideally, the steps to reproduce should be a list element; HTML lists can be inserted into the defect description via the text editor user interface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If additional information is available, such as a stack trace, then it is separated from the previous sections by another horizontal line per block of additional information. Most often, stack traces will preserve the formatting of the HTML element that they were copied from; to avoid copying this formatting to the defect body, please first remove it. One of the easiest ways of accomplishing this while also preserving newline characters is to paste into a text document,
                    select all, copy again, and finally paste into targetprocess.

                  <p>
                    It is preferable that attachments are captured via Greenshot (for image) and OBS Studio (for video); this is explained in more detail in the Tools section of this handbook. Video attachments can only be uploaded as files, while image attachments can be either uploaded as files or pasted in comments as inline images. The golden rule is: If an inline image takes up too much screen space, then upload it as a file instead. Too much space would be an image that would cause the
                    comment box to expand in height more than twice the default size.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When uploading attachments, please make sure that the file name is a timestamp in the format "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS". This can be configured in the software product used to capture the attachment.

                  <p>
                    There are many built-in as well as custom fields that can be set while logging a defect. The most commonly used ones are the following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h5>
                        State
                      </h5>
                      <p>
                        Throughout its lifecycle, a defect will transition through several states.
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Open:</strong> A newly logged defect. Not yet confirmed so it could potentially be invalid, a duplicate, it may need more information, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Confirmed:</strong> A defect that has been confirmed to be valid by one of the developers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Requirements:</strong> If a developer encounters an infrastructure issue that prevents them from starting work on the defect, then they move the card to this state. An infrastructure requirement may be, for example, a lack of permissions to access a server or a chamber, a DNS issue that may prevent the developer from connecting to the VPN, or client data that may need to be wiped from an import chamber prior to starting work on the defect.</li>
                        <li><strong>In Progress:</strong> A developer has started fixing this defect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Awaiting Merge:</strong> A developer has finished fixing this defect and is now waiting for the changes to be merged to the branch that will be deployed to the environment on which the defect needs to be retested.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parked:</strong> A defect ends up in this state if something causes the development work to be put on hold for an undetermined amount of time. An example of why this may happen could be that a defect was logged for a component that will soon be replaced.</li>
                        <li><strong>Resolved:</strong> The defect has been fixed, and the fix has been deployed and is available for retesting and regression testing. Defects previously in the Awaiting Merge state are automatically moved to the Resolved state once the changes have been deployed; this works via an integration between targetprocess and GitLab.</li>
                        <li><strong>Awaiting Merge To Production:</strong> This state is for defects that have been fix verified and that are in the queue to be deployed to production sites.</li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Done:</strong> The plan is for the Done state to be automated in the same way that the Resolved state is; once the fix has been verified, while the defect is in the Awaiting Merge To Production state, the card will be automatically marked Done by the GitLab integration after the changes have been deployed to production sites. Currently this doesn’t work this way; currently defects need to be marked Done manually once the fix has been verified during retesting
                          and regression testing.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                        Some states require the user to leave a comment when moving the card to that state. This comment is plain-text only, so if tags, URLs, screenshots etc. need to be included in this comment then please enter the text-only part first so that targetprocess allows changing the state and then go back to your comment and update it with any edits that may be required.

                        Teams can be assigned to defects and, in most cases, it will only be possible to assign a single team per defect. This is normally done after logging a new defect; if it is not obvious who the assigned developer should be, then the defect gets assigned to either the Developers team or the Portal Developers team. Do not speculate; only assign a defect to a specific developer if it was found in code that they wrote. Assigning a team to a defect, and generally to a
                        targetprocess entity, can kick off a team workflow which can divide a state into multiple sub-states.
                      </p>
                      <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\05-team-assignments.png" alt="Logging Defects: Team Assignments" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        Apart from team assignments, individual people can be assigned to specific roles. More than one person can be assigned to a single role.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The people assigned to the role that is responsible for the defect’s current state will appear in a heavier font. For example, in the next image, the defect is in the Parked state and the role responsible for the Parked state in this example is the Support Person role, so Colin’s name appears in bold text.

                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> This severity is reserved for nice-to-have features. Defects that usually fall into this category are quality-of-life changes that enhance the user's experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trivial:</strong> This severity is mostly for typos and minute cosmetic defects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor:</strong> Reserved for minor functionality issues and more noticeable cosmetic defects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Average:</strong> The default defect severity. Average is used for garden-variety functionality issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Major:</strong> Reserved for major functionality issues. These defects will usually throw an exception.</li>
                        <li><strong>Critical:</strong> The defects that fall into this category are severe performance issues that cause the application to freeze or hang, runtime failures that cause the application to crash, serious functionality issues that prevent users from progressing with their work, exploitable security holes, data loss, data corruption, defects that cause clinical risk.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blocker:</strong> This is reserved for defects that prevent the progress of internal testing.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        Business values are defined by the following Risk Assessment Matrix. Each business value is determined by the combination of the defect’s severity and its likelihood of occurrence.

                        Custom Fields
                      </h5>
                      <p>
                        Custom fields are defined in the targetprocess admin configuration section, and these can be of several types such as drop-down list, free-text field, boolean control, computed field (calculated from the values of other fields by a defined formula) etc. The most notable custom fields are:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Resolution:</strong> Defines the reason for moving defects into certain states. Common uses of the Resolution field include:
                          <ul>
                            <li>After a developer fixes a defect, they will mark it Resolved and set the Resolution to Fixed.</li>
                            <li>When a developer believes the defect is invalid, they will mark it Resolved and set the Resolution to Invalid.</li>
                            <li>After a defect fails retesting, a QA person will move it back to the Confirmed state and set the Resolution to Reopened.</li>
                            <li>When a developer needs more information on a defect from a QA person, they will mark it Resolved and set the Resolution to Need More Info.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <span>Several other values are available for the Resolution field, however these are less commonly used.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Support Ticket ID:</strong> If a request for QA review includes a support ticket ID, then that ID needs to be copied over to the defect logged off the back of that request. More information about this is available in the section detailing the Requests For QA Review workflow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Is Live:</strong> A boolean (true or false) field that specifies whether the logged defect reproduces in production code or not. The default value is “false”.</li>
                        <li><strong>State Of Fix:</strong> The value of this field never needs to be set manually; it is controlled by an integration with GitLab, and the value will automatically be set to “Fix is on Development” when the fix for the defect has been merged to the development branch and to “Fix is on Development and Production” when the fix for the defect has been deployed to the production environment.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h5>
                        Relations
                      </h5>
                      <p>
                        Relations in targetprocess are symmetrical links that connect two entities. They can be can be of one of five types: Relation, Dependency, Blocker, Link and Duplicate.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A relation between two targetprocess entities is similar to a flow, so if a defect was logged off the back of a request, for instance, then the defect will be linked by an outbound relation from the request.
                      </p>
                      <p></p>
                      <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\10-outbound-relations.png" alt="Logging Defects: Outbound Relations" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        Because relations are symmetrical, the above means that in the defect context the request is linked by an inbound relation to the defect.
                      </p>
                      <p></p>
                      <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\11-inbound-relations.png" alt="Logging Defects: Inbound Relations" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        An easy way to determine the context of one or more relations is to think of the grey circle at the middle of the diagram as the current entity. In our examples above, in the request context the defect is an outbound entity while in the defect context the request is an inbound entity.
                      </p>

                    Grammar/Punctuation/Syntax/Semantics
                  </h4>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Grammar:</strong> Please always try to use correct grammar when logging defects and/or creating comments. To facilitate this, the Grammarly add-on can be installed in your browser. More information about Grammarly is available in the Tools section of this document. Examples of commonly made grammatical errors include:
                      <ul>
                        <li>The incorrect use of homophones such as Then/Than, Their/There/They’re, To/Too, Your/You’re, Of/Off.</li>
                        <li>Using nouns instead of verbs. Examples: a) <strike>the user is unable to login</strike> the user is unable to log in; b) <strike>the user is experiencing issues attempting to setup the configuration</strike> the user is experiencing issues attempting to set up the configuration; c) <strike>we will rollout a new version of the application</strike> we will roll out a new version of the application;</li>
                        <li>Incorrectly capitalized acronyms or initialisms. Examples: a) <strike>Json</strike> JSON; b) <strike>Asap</strike> ASAP;</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Punctuation:</strong> Correct punctuation matters, so always try to keep on top of that. Grammarly, most of the time, can help with this as well. Examples of commonly made punctuation mistakes include:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Not ending sentences with a period, or an exclamation/question mark where appropriate.</li>
                        <li>Using dashes for hyphens and vice versa. A hyphen (-) is a punctuation mark that’s used to join words or parts of words, whereas a dash (–) is longer than a hyphen and is commonly used to indicate a range or a pause</li>
                        <li>Using apostrophes in plural words. Examples: a) <strike>SMS's</strike> SMSs; b) <strike>ID's</strike> IDs;</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Syntax:</strong> Syntax is essentially about what word comes before and after another word. Please make sure your sentences don't end up sounding like tongue twisters. English can be weird. It can be understood through tough thorough thought, though.</li>
                    <li><strong>Semantics:</strong> Semantics are concerned with the meaning of signifiers such as words, phrases, signs, and symbols. In terms of meaning, some very important guidelines on logging defects are:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Never log any defects that sound like requests for the developer. An incorrect defect title would be <em>“<strike>Please change the color of this text.</strike>”</em>, however the correct title could be <em>"Inconsistent text color being used."</em>.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Never be subjective while describing a defect. An incorrect description would be <em>“<strike>When I logged in, I was presented with an error message.</strike>”</em>, however the correct description could be <em>“After logging in, it was observed that an error occurs.”</em>. Always try to avoid describing defects in the first person, and always try to be as objective as possible.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>I will end this section with a really bad joke: A wife asks her husband, a programmer, “Could you please go shopping for me and buy one carton of milk? And if they have eggs, please get six.” A short time later, the programmer comes back with six cartons of milk. His wife asks, “Why did you buy six cartons of milk?” to which the programmer replies, “They had eggs.”.</span>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <h4>
                    Comments
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    While creating comments in targetprocess, it is possible to tag users or entities in the comment body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tagging users can be done by inserting an @ sign followed by starting to type the user’s name and then selecting them from an auto-complete list; doing so will cause the tagged user to receive a notification of the newly created comment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tagging entities can be done by typing “ID: ” followed by the targetprocess ID of the entity.
                  </p>
                  <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\12-comment-tags.png" alt="Logging Defects: Comment Tags" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Tagged users and entities will resolve to interactive elements as soon as the comment has been saved. These can now be clicked to navigate to the tagged user and/or entity.
                  </p>
                  <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\13-comment-links.png" alt="Logging Defects: Comment Links" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                  <p></p>
                  <p>While tagging allows users to send notifications to other users by including them in the comment, another way of sending notifications to other users that a new comment has been created is to use the checkboxes under the comment editor. By ticking these, email notifications can be sent to the card owner, the people assigned to the card, and/or the members of the project in which the card was created.</p>
                  <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\14-comment-notifications.png" alt="Logging Defects: Comment Notifications" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Lastly, in order to make the best use of the comments section, please make sure that you are using the comment sort order that is right for you. This is a matter of personal preference and only needs to be done once, as it is a per-user setting and not a per-card setting. I personally prefer oldest first, because it works better for me to be able to go through the comment history from the top to the bottom.</p>
