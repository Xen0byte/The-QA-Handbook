          <p>It is recommended, but not required, to clear all your current bookmarks before importing the ones attached to this QA Handbook. This is because the imported bookmarks will be added to your already-existing bookmarks, which may result in bookmark duplication.</p>

                    <strong>All-Purpose Test Data:</strong
                    ><span>
                      One of the easiest to use realistic data generators publicly available on the Internet is <a href="https://www.mockaroo.com/">mockaroo</a> which also has a very generous free tier. It can generate, at the time of writing this,
                      143 type of data ranging from names, addresses and NHS numbers to avatar URLs, drug names and company names. Mockaroo also supports regular expressions, so users can create their own data types.</span
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order to generate data, simply add the required columns, select an output type and then either download or preview the results. The output type is a matter of personal preference; I personally lean towards JSON, however a table
                    format such as Excel may be easier to look at for most people.

                  <p></p>
                  <p>The number of results is defined by the numbers of rows set to generate. Only up to 1000 rows can be generated as part of the free tier, however that is more than enough for most non-enterprise users.</p>

                  <p>
                    Another very powerful tool for generating test data is faker.js, which has the advantage of being open source. Setting it up involves a bit of technical complexity, however comprehensive instructions on setup and usage can be
                    found on the <a href="https://github.com/marak/faker.js">faker.js GitHub page</a>. The library is also available as an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker">NPM package</a>.

                      Mobile numbers in the range 07700 900000 to 07700 900999 can be used for testing purposes as these are reserved by Ofcom, which is the regulator for communications services in the United Kingdom. Ofcom also provides
                      <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/information-for-industry/numbering/numbers-for-drama">a range of geographic landline numbers</a> that can be used for testing.</span

                  <p>
                    Please note that none of these phone numbers are allocated to communications providers, so calling or messaging them will not work, however they are in the correct format and using them ensures that calls or text messages are not
                    received by real people which is very important because text messages or automated calls may potentially contain sensitive test data.

              <h3>Logging Defects</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Structure</h4>
                  <p>The structure of a defect card in targetprocess should be in accordance with the following guidelines:</p>
                  <p>The body of the defect starts with a detailed description. Please be sure to include all the relevant information, while avoiding extra unneeded information that may confuse the reader.</p>
                  <p>The description is separated from the steps to reproduce by a horizontal line. This can either be inserted via the user interface of the editor, or by adding a &lt;hr&gt; tag while inspecting the source of the defect body.</p>
                  <p>
                    The second section contains details on where the issue reproduces and what the steps to reproduce are. Credentials and environment variables are typed in on a single line in the format “system > user > password (optional) >
                    browser (optional)”. The browser is only required if the issue is browser specific. Examples include “system.meddbase.com > MMS.User@HCA > Mozilla Firefox” or “qa.meddbase.com > BRL.Vlad > myPassword”. Following this line are the
                    steps to reproduce, which must be typed on sequentially numbered rows. Please don’t skip any logical step, while also making sure that the STR are short and concise, as not to confuse the reader. Ideally, the steps to reproduce
                    should be a list element; HTML lists can be inserted into the defect description via the text editor user interface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If additional information is available, such as a stack trace, then it is separated from the previous sections by another horizontal line per block of additional information. Most often, stack traces will preserve the formatting
                    of the HTML element that they were copied from; to avoid copying this formatting to the defect body, please first remove it. One of the easiest ways of accomplishing this while also preserving newline characters is to paste into a
                    text document, select all, copy again, and finally paste into targetprocess.

                  <h4>Attachments</h4>
                  <p>
                    It is preferable that attachments are captured via Greenshot (for image) and OBS Studio (for video); this is explained in more detail in the Tools section of this handbook. Video attachments can only be uploaded as files, while
                    image attachments can be either uploaded as files or pasted in comments as inline images. The golden rule is: If an inline image takes up too much screen space, then upload it as a file instead. Too much space would be an image
                    that would cause the comment box to expand in height more than twice the default size.
                  </p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p>When uploading attachments, please make sure that the file name is a timestamp in the format "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS". This can be configured in the software product used to capture the attachment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Defect Parameters</h4>
                  <p>There are many built-in as well as custom fields that can be set while logging a defect. The most commonly used ones are the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h5>State</h5>
                      <p>Throughout its lifecycle, a defect will transition through several states.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>New:</strong><span> A newly logged defect. Not yet confirmed so it could potentially be invalid, a duplicate, it may need more information, etc.</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Confirmed:</strong><span> A defect that has been confirmed to be valid by one of the developers.</span></li>
                        <li><strong>In Progress:</strong><span> A developer has started fixing this defect.</span></li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Awaiting Merge:</strong
                          ><span> A developer has finished fixing this defect and is now waiting for the changes to be merged to the branch that will be deployed to the environment on which the defect needs to be retested.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Parked:</strong
                          ><span>
                            A defect ends up in this state if something causes the development work to be put on hold for an undetermined amount of time. An example of why this may happen could be that a defect was logged for a component that will
                            soon be replaced.</span
                          >

                          <strong>Resolved:</strong
                          ><span>
                            The defect has been fixed, and the fix has been deployed and is available for retesting and regression testing. Defects previously in the Awaiting Merge state are automatically moved to the Resolved state once the changes
                            have been deployed; this works via an integration between targetprocess and GitLab.</span
                          >
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Awaiting Merge To Production:</strong><span> This state is for defects that have been fix verified and that are in the queue to be deployed to production sites.</span></li>

                            This state is automated in the same way that the Resolved state is; once the fix has been verified, while the defect is in the Awaiting Merge To Production state, the card will automatically be marked Done by the GitLab
                            integration after the changes have been deployed to production sites.</span

                        Some states require the user to leave a comment when moving the card to that state. This comment is plain-text only, so if tags, URLs, screenshots etc. need to be included in this comment then please enter the text-only part
                        first so that targetprocess allows changing the state and then go back to your comment and update it with any edits that may be required.

                      <h5>Assignments</h5>
                      <p>
                        Teams can be assigned to defects and, in most cases, it will only be possible to assign a single team per defect. Assigning a team to a defect, and generally to a targetprocess entity, can kick off a team workflow which can
                        divide a state into multiple sub-states, as can be seen below. Only assign teams to targetprocess entities if instructed to do so by the QA manager.
                      </p>
                      <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\03-logging-defects\05-team-assignments.png" alt="Logging Defects: Team Assignments" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        Apart from team assignments, individual people can be assigned to specific roles. More than one person can be assigned to a single role. Only assign individual people to targetprocess entities if instructed to do so by the QA
                        manager.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The people assigned to the role that is responsible for the defect’s current state will appear in a heavier font. For example, in the next image, the defect is in the Parked state and the role responsible for the Parked state
                        in this example is the Support Person role, so Colin’s name appears in bold text.

                      <h5>Severities & Business Values</h5>
                      <p>The severity and business value of a defect dictate the priority of fixing that defect. Defect severities are 'set in stone', while business values are determined by a Risk Assessment Matrix.</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\03-logging-defects\07-severities-and-business-values.png" alt="Logging Defects: Severities & Business Values" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                      <p></p>
                      <p>The seven severities currently defined in targetprocess are the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Enhancement:</strong
                          ><span>
                            This severity is reserved for nice-to-have features. Defects that usually fall into this category are quality-of-life changes that enhance the user's experience. Occasionally, missing features that would improve on an MVP
                            (Minimum Viable Product) may fall into this category as well.</span
                          >
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Trivial:</strong><span> This severity is mostly for typos and minute cosmetic defects.</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Minor:</strong><span> Reserved for minor functionality issues and more noticeable cosmetic defects.</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Average:</strong><span> The default defect severity. Average is used for garden-variety functionality issues.</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Major:</strong><span> Reserved for major functionality issues. These defects will usually throw an exception.</span></li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Critical:</strong
                          ><span>
                            The defects that fall into this category are severe performance issues that cause the application to freeze or hang, runtime failures that cause the application to crash, serious functionality issues that prevent users
                            from progressing with their work, exploitable security holes, data loss, data corruption, defects with associated clinical risk, et cetera.</span
                          >
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Blocker:</strong><span> This is reserved for defects that prevent the progress of internal testing or for showstoppers that are impeding a rollout.</span></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>Business values are defined by the following Risk Assessment Matrix. Each business value is determined by the combination of the defect’s severity and its likelihood of occurrence.</p>

                      <h5>Custom Fields</h5>
                      <p>
                        Custom fields are defined in the targetprocess admin configuration section, and these can be of several types such as drop-down list, free-text field, boolean control, computed field (calculated from the values of other fields
                        by a defined formula) etc. The most notable custom fields are:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Resolution:</strong><span> Defines the reason for moving defects into certain states. Common uses of the Resolution field include:</span>
                          <ul>
                            <li>After a developer fixes a defect, they will mark it Resolved and set the Resolution to Fixed.</li>
                            <li>When a developer believes the defect is invalid, they will mark it Resolved and set the Resolution to Invalid.</li>
                            <li>After a defect fails retesting, a QA person will move it back to the Confirmed state and set the Resolution to Reopened.</li>
                            <li>When a developer needs more information on a defect from a QA person, they will mark it Resolved and set the Resolution to Need More Info.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <span>Several other values are available for the Resolution field, however these are less commonly used.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Support Ticket ID:</strong
                          ><span>
                            If a request for QA review includes a support ticket ID, then that ID needs to be copied over to the defect logged off the back of that request. More information about this is available in the section detailing the
                            Requests For QA Review workflow.</span
                          >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>State Of Fix:</strong
                          ><span>
                            The value of this field never needs to be set manually; it is controlled by an integration with GitLab, and the value will automatically be set to “Fix is on Development” when the fix for the defect has been merged to the
                            development branch and to “Fix is on Development and Production” when the fix for the defect has been deployed to the production environment.</span

                      <h5>Relations</h5>
                      <p>Relations in targetprocess are symmetrical links that connect two entities. They can be of one of five types: Relation, Dependency, Blocker, Link and Duplicate.</p>
                      <p>A relation between two targetprocess entities is similar to a flow, so if a defect was logged off the back of a request, for instance, then the defect will be linked by an outbound relation from the request.</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\03-logging-defects\10-outbound-relations.png" alt="Logging Defects: Outbound Relations" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                      <p></p>
                      <p>Because relations are symmetrical, the above means that in the defect context the request is linked by an inbound relation to the defect.</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <img src="assets\img\04-workflows\03-logging-defects\11-inbound-relations.png" alt="Logging Defects: Inbound Relations" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        An easy way to determine the context of one or more relations is to think of the grey circle at the middle of the diagram as the current entity. In our examples above, in the request context the defect is an outbound entity
                        while in the defect context the request is an inbound entity.

                        Please always try to use correct grammar when logging defects and/or creating comments. To facilitate this, the Grammarly add-on can be installed in your browser. More information about Grammarly is available in the Tools
                        section of this document. Examples of commonly made grammatical errors include:</span

                      <ul>
                        <li>The incorrect use of homophones such as Then/Than, Their/There/They’re, To/Too, Your/You’re, Of/Off.</li>
                        <li>
                          Using nouns instead of verbs. Examples: a) <s>the user is unable to login</s> the user is unable to log in; b) <s>the user is experiencing issues attempting to setup the configuration</s> the user is experiencing issues
                          attempting to set up the configuration; c) <s>we will rollout a new version of the application</s> we will roll out a new version of the application;
                        </li>
                        <li>Incorrectly capitalized acronyms or initialisms. Examples: a) <s>Json</s> JSON; b) <s>Asap</s> ASAP;</li>

                      <strong>Punctuation:</strong><span> Correct punctuation matters, so always try to keep on top of that. Grammarly, most of the time, can help with this as well. Examples of commonly made punctuation mistakes include:</span>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Not ending sentences with a period, or an exclamation/question mark where appropriate.</li>
                        <li>Using dashes for hyphens and vice versa. A hyphen (-) is a punctuation mark that’s used to join words or parts of words, whereas a dash (–) is longer than a hyphen and is commonly used to indicate a range or a pause</li>
                        <li>Using apostrophes in plural words. Examples: a) <s>SMS's</s> SMSs; b) <s>ID's</s> IDs;</li>

                        Syntax is essentially about what word comes before and after another word. Please make sure your sentences don't end up sounding like tongue twisters. English can be weird; it can be understood through tough thorough thought,
                        though.</span

                    Tagging users can be done by inserting an @ sign followed by starting to type the user’s name and then selecting them from an auto-complete list; doing so will cause the tagged user to receive a notification of the newly created
                    comment.
                  </p>
                  <p>Tagging entities can be done by typing “ID: ” followed by the targetprocess ID of the entity.</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p>Tagged users and entities will resolve to interactive elements as soon as the comment has been saved. These can now be clicked to navigate to the tagged user and/or entity.</p>

                  <p>
                    While tagging allows users to send notifications to other users by including them in the comment, another way of sending notifications to other users that a new comment has been created is to use the checkboxes under the comment
                    editor. By ticking these, email notifications can be sent to the card owner, the people assigned to the card, and/or the members of the project in which the card was created.

                  <p>
                    Lastly, in order to make the best use of the comments section, please make sure that you are using the comment sort order that is right for you. This is a matter of personal preference and only needs to be done once, as it is a
                    per-user setting and not a per-card setting. I personally prefer oldest first, because it works better for me to be able to go through the comment history from the top to the bottom.

              <h3>Levels Of Testing</h3>
              <p>Software Testing Levels are the different stages of the software development lifecycle where testing is conducted. There are four levels of software testing: Unit >> Integration >> System >> Acceptance.</p>
              <img src="assets\img\05-information-library\01-levels-of-testing\01-the-four-levels-of-testing.png" alt="Information Library: Levels Of Testing" class="img-fluid img-container" />
              <p></p>
              <p>Some tend to include Regression Testing as a separate level of software testing but that is a misconception. Regression Testing is, in fact, just a type of testing that can be performed at any of the four main levels.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Unit Testing:</strong
                  ><span>
                    A level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested. Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the
                    "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming, a unit is often an entire
                    interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method. By writing tests first for the smallest testable units, then the compound behaviors between those, one can build up comprehensive tests for complex applications.</span
                  >
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                  <strong>Integration Testing:</strong
                  ><span>
                    Sometimes called Integration And Testing (abbreviated I&T), is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the
                    interaction between integrated units/components. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates,
                    and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing.</span
                  >
                  <p></p>
                  <img src="assets\img\05-information-library\01-levels-of-testing\02-integration-testing.png" alt="Information Library: Levels Of Testing: Integration Testing" class="img-fluid img-container" />
                  <p></p>
                  <p>The most common approaches to integration testing are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Big Bang: An approach to Integration Testing where all or most of the units are combined together and tested at one go. This approach is taken when the testing team receives the entire software in a bundle. So what is the
                      difference between Big Bang Integration Testing and System Testing? Well, the former tests only the interactions between the units while the latter tests the entire system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Top-Down: An approach to Integration Testing where top-level units are tested first and lower-level units are tested step by step after that. This approach is taken when a top-down development approach is followed. Stubs are
                      needed to simulate lower-level units which may not be available during the initial phases of testing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Bottom-Up: An approach to Integration Testing where bottom-level units are tested first and upper-level units step by step after that. This approach is taken when a bottom-up development approach is followed. Drivers are needed
                      to simulate higher-level units which may not be available during the initial phases of testing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hybrid/Sandwich: An approach to Integration Testing which is a combination of the Top-Down and Bottom-Up approaches.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Test Stubs and Test Drivers act as substitutes to incomplete or missing modules. They do not implement the entire programming logic of the module but just simulate data communication with the calling module. Stubs are called by
                    the module under test, while Drivers call the module under test.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>System Testing:</strong
                  ><span>
                    Also referred to as System-Level Tests or System-Integration Testing, is the process in which a QA team evaluates how the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application.</span
                  >
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    System testing verifies that an application performs tasks as designed. This step, a kind of black box testing, focuses on the functionality of an application. System testing, for example, might check that every kind of user input
                    produces the intended output across the application.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With system testing, a QA team gauges if an application meets all of its requirements, which includes technical, business and functional requirements. To accomplish this, the QA team might utilize a variety of test types,
                    including performance, usability, load testing and functional tests.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Acceptance Testing:</strong
                  ><span> A level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.</span>
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                  Internal Acceptance Testing (also known as <strong>Alpha Testing</strong>) is performed by members of the organization that developed the software but who are not directly involved in the project (Development or Testing). Usually,
                  it is the members of Product Management, Sales and/or Customer Support.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <span>External Acceptance Testing is performed by people who are not employees of the organization that developed the software.</span>
                <ul>
                  <li>Customer Acceptance Testing is performed by the customers of the organization that developed the software, if they are the ones who asked the organization to develop the software.</li>
                  <li>User Acceptance Testing (also known as <strong>Beta Testing</strong>) is performed by the end users of the software. They can be the customers themselves or the customers’ customers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Lastly, to reiterate through the four levels of testing, we could use the following analogy: During the process of manufacturing a ballpoint pen, the cap, the body, the tail and clip, the ink cartridge and the ballpoint are produced
                separately. Unit Testing is then performed on the individual components. When two or more units are ready, they are assembled and Integration Testing is performed to assess the interactions between the integrated components. When the
                complete pen is integrated, System Testing is performed. Once System Testing is complete, Acceptance Testing is performed so as to confirm that the ballpoint pen meets all the requirements and that it's ready to be made available to
                the end-user.

                  <strong>Sentence Case:</strong><span> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span>
                  <p>
                    A mixed-case style in which the first word of the sentence is capitalised, as well as proper nouns and other words as required by a more specific rule. This is generally equivalent to the baseline universal standard of formal
                    English orthography.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Title Case (Capital Case, Headline Style):</strong><span> The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Dog</span>
                  <p>
                    A mixed-case style with all words capitalised, except for certain subsets (particularly articles and short prepositions and conjunctions) defined by rules that are not universally standardised. The standardisation is only at the
                    level of house styles and individual style manuals. In text processing, title case usually involves the capitalisation of all words irrespective of their part of speech. This simplified variant of title case is also known as start
                    case or initial caps.
                  </p>

                  <strong>All Caps (All Uppercase):</strong><span> THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG</span>
                  <p>
                    A unicase style with capital letters only. This can be used in headings and special situations, such as for typographical emphasis in text made on a typewriter. With the advent of the Internet, the all-caps style is more often
                    used for emphasis; however, it is considered poor netiquette by some to type in all capitals, and said to be tantamount to shouting. Long spans of Latin-alphabet text in all upper-case are harder to read because of the absence of
                    the ascenders and descenders found in lower-case letters, which can aid recognition. In some cultures it is common to write family names in all caps to distinguish them from the given names, especially in identity documents such
                    as passports.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Small Caps:</strong><span class="small-caps"> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span>
                  <p>
                    Similar in form to capital letters but roughly the size of a lower-case "x", small caps can be used instead of lower-case letters and combined with regular caps in a mixed-case fashion. This is a feature of certain fonts such as
                    Copperplate Gothic. According to various typographical traditions, the height of small caps can be equal to or slightly larger than the x-height of the typeface (the smaller variant is sometimes called petite caps and may also be
                    mixed with the larger variant). Small caps can be used for acronyms, names, mathematical entities, computer commands in printed text, business or personal printed stationery letterheads, and other situations where a given phrase
                    needs to be distinguished from the main text.

                  <strong>All Lowercase:</strong><span> the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span>
                  <p>
                    A unicase style with no capital letters. This is sometimes used for artistic effect, such as in poetry. Also commonly seen in computer languages, and in informal electronic communications such as SMS language and instant messaging
                    (avoiding the Shift key, to type more quickly).

                  <strong>Camel Case:</strong><span> theQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog</span>
                  <p>
                    Spaces and punctuation are removed and the first letter of each word is capitalised. When the first letter of the first word is lowercase ("iPod", "eBay", etc.), the case is usually known as Lower Camel Case (illustratively:
                    camelCase).

                  <p>
                    Spaces and punctuation are removed and the first letter of each word is capitalised. If this includes the first letter of the first word ("MasterCard", "PowerPoint", etc.), the case is usually called Upper Camel Case, Pascal Case
                    (illustratively: PascalCase), or Bumpy Case.

                  <p>
                    Punctuation is removed and spaces are replaced by single underscores. Normally the letters share the same case (e.g. "UPPER_CASE_EMBEDDED_UNDERSCORE" or "lower_case_embedded_underscore"), but the case can be mixed as well. The
                    style may also be called Pothole Case, especially in Python programming, in which this convention is often used for naming variables. Illustratively, it may be rendered snake_case or pothole_case. When all-upper-case, it may be
                    referred to as Screaming Snake Case (or SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE).

                    Similar to Snake Case, above, except hyphens rather than underscores are used to replace spaces (illustratively: kebab-case). It is also known as Spinal Case, Param Case, LISP Case, and Dash Case. If every word is capitalised, the
                    style is known as Train Case (or TRAIN-CASE).

                  <p>
                    Mixed case with no semantic or syntactic significance to the use of the capitals. Sometimes only vowels are upper case, at other times upper and lower case are alternated, but often it is simply random. The name comes from the
                    sarcastic or ironic implication that it was used in an attempt by the writer to convey their own coolness. It is also used to mock the violation of standard English case conventions by marketers in the naming of computer software
                    packages, even when there is no technical requirement to do so – e.g., Sun Microsystems' naming of a windowing system NeWS. Illustrative naming of the style is, naturally, random: stUdlY cAps, StUdLy CaPs, etc.

                    Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so,
                    you avoid the integration hell that usually happens when people wait for release day to merge their changes into the release branch.</span

                  <strong>Continuous Delivery:</strong
                  ><span>
                    Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. This means that on top of having automated your testing, you also have
                    automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button.</span

                  <p>
                    In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements. However, if you truly want to get the benefits of continuous delivery, you should deploy to
                    production as early as possible to make sure that you release small batches that are easy to troubleshoot in case of a problem.

                  <strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong
                  ><span>
                    Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a
                    failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.</span

                  <p>
                    Continuous deployment is an excellent way to accelerate the feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the team as there isn't a Release Day anymore. Developers can focus on building software, and they see their work
                    go live minutes after they've finished working on it.

                <p>To put it simply continuous integration is part of both continuous delivery and continuous deployment. And continuous deployment is like continuous delivery, except that releases happen automatically.</p>
